### Healthcare Prediction on Diabetic Patients using Python 🏥🔍
## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using various machine learning algorithms in Python. By analyzing key health parameters, this model assists healthcare professionals in early diabetes risk assessment, enabling timely intervention and management.
## Dataset
The dataset includes the following health indicators:
- Pregnancies 
- Glucose Levels 
- Blood Pressure 
- Skin Thickness 
- Insulin Levels 
- BMI (Body Mass Index) 
- Diabetes Pedigree Function 
- Age 
- Target Variable: Presence or absence of diabetes (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a reliable predictive tool that helps healthcare professionals identify patients at risk of diabetes through machine learning techniques.
Machine Learning Models Used
Various models were implemented and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression – 📊 Best performing model with 77.52% accuracy
- Random Forest – 🌲 76.85% accuracy with improved feature importance insights
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – 🔢 Balanced accuracy at 72.46%
- Decision Tree Classifier – 🌳 Lower accuracy at 71.5%, indicating some predictive limitations

## Key Findings & Conclusion
✔ Logistic Regression emerged as the most reliable model with 77.52% accuracy, making it an ideal choice for diabetes risk prediction. 

✔ Decision Tree performed lower, suggesting the need for further tuning.

✔ Random Forest & KNN showed moderate success, providing alternative solutions depending on interpretability and efficiency requirements.

✔ Future improvements could explore ensemble techniques or deep learning for enhanced performance.
